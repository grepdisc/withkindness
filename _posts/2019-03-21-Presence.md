The Faithful Fools' mission statement begins, “We are called to a ministry of presence.” At first, I had little idea what presence even meant. Over time, I find myself discovering more aspects of presence and why it matters.

### Presence is ...

> Listening to another;

> Listening more deeply with a closed mouth and an open body;

> Showing up and being in a space;

> Walking together in silence or in conversation;

> Paying quiet attention while someone interviews a doctor;

> Being a barrier as someone changes their soiled clothes at a bus shelter;

> Finding a story beneath someone’s insults through which humor can show real connection;

> Holding judgements and expectations with a lightness;

> Hearing a question or statement that seems silly, and recognizing it requires no correction;

> Remaining calm with an open heart and child-like mind, especially in times of elevated emotions;

> Experiencing pain, sadness, or a headache, but staying with it rather than seeking refuge;

> Feeling past trauma in one’s body, yet feeling secure to observe and explore;

> Feeling heard, whole, and healed;

> Offering immersive attention;

> Hearing and accepting another’s experience;

> Truly caring about what someone chooses to share;

> Respecting one’s and others’ boundaries, while seeking to recognize and dismantle barriers that separate us;

> Both a way of being and an exhausting practice.

> Presence is opening oneself to what can be, without knowing what that may be.
