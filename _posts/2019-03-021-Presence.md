“We are called to a ministry of presence.” At first, I had little idea what presence even meant. Over time with the Faithful Fools, I find myself discovering more aspects of presence and why it matters. Presence is ...

Listening to another;

Listening more deeply with a closed mouth and an open body;

Showing up and being in a space;

Walking together in silence or in conversation;

Paying quiet attention while someone interviews a doctor;

Being a barrier as someone changes their soiled clothes at a bus shelter;

Finding a story beneath someone’s insults through which humor can show real connection;

Holding judgements and expectations with a lightness;

Hearing a question or statement that seems silly, and recognizing it requires no correction;

Remaining calm with an open heart and child-like mind, especially in times of elevated emotions;

Experiencing pain, sadness, or a headache, but staying with it rather than seeking refuge;

Feeling past trauma in one’s body, yet feeling secure to observe and explore;

Feeling heard, whole, and healed;

Offering immersive attention;

Hearing and accepting another’s experience;

Truly caring about what someone chooses to share;

Respecting one’s and others’ boundaries, while seeking to recognize and dismantle barriers that separate us;

Both a way of being and an exhausting practice.

Presence is opening oneself to what can be, without knowing what that may be.
